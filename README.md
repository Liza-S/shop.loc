# Online store of phones, smartphones and tablets from RealFive courses

This is my final project from [RealFive - web programming courses](https://www.facebook.com/realfive/). This is an online store for phones, smartphones and tablets on own site engine.

Online store opportunities: 

* View a list of products by categories

* Search by part of the product name

* Adding product to cart works through Ajax

Shopping Cart Features: 

* Change of quantity of goods

* Remove item from cart

* Clearing the entire basket

* When you click on the "place an order" button, a modal window appears in which the buyer should enter: e-mail, phone number, name, and address. This, and the order of the buyer is sent to the admin part of the site.

Possibilities of the admin part of the site:

* View, add, edit, and delete categories

* View, add, edit, and delete items

* View and change the order status

Login to the admin panel via the authorization page.
